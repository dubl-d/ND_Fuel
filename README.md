# ND_Fuel<br>
This script originated from Andyyy7666<br>
This script had no license so I am not including one and unless requested by Andy himself this will remain up.<br>
This script was originally made for the ND_Framework, I doubt support will be offered.<br>
This was tested on ESX Legacy - Sept 2022 Update - Running Gamebuild 2612 & 2699<br>
I tested this with ox_inventory as well with money as an item.<br>
This was converted by Double D#0001.<br>
