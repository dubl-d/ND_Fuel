#ND_Fuel
#This script originated from Andyyy7666
#This script had no license so I am not including one and unless requested by Andy himself this will remain up.
#From what I could see this script used LegacyFuel as a base and Andy & his team optimized TF out of it.
#This script was originally made for the ND_Framework, I doubt support will be offered.
#This was tested on ESX Legacy - Sept 2022 Update - Running Gamebuild 2612 & 2699
#I tested this with ox_inventory as well with money as an item.
#This was converted by Double D#0001.
